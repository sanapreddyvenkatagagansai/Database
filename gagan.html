<p3>A  database  is  a  collection  of  logically  related  records  that  are  in  the  form  of different 
 tables. A  Database  contains  facts  and  figures  in  Tables  that  can  be  further  used  in  the processing 
 of  data  and  extracting  useful  information. For  Example,  various  databases  may  be  maintained  in  a  university, 
 like  students database  and  faculty  database.</p><br>
<h3>Database  Management  System :</h3><br>
<p>DBMS is an application  which  controls  functions  like  creating, manipulating,  deleting  and  updating 
 a  database.  It stores  data  in  such  a  way  that  retrieving  and  manipulating  information become  easier.
 Creating  and  Processing  forms  is  not  a  function  of  a  database  management system.</p>
